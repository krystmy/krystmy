#test finding a path

created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph
added node D to graph
added node E to graph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 2.000 from B to C in graph
added edge 3.000 from C to D in graph
added edge 4.000 from D to E in graph

path from A to E:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 2.000
C to D with weight 3.000
D to E with weight 4.000
