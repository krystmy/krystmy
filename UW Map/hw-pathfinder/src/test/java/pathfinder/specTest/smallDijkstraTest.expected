#test finding a small least cost path

created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph
added node D to graph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 2.000 from B to C in graph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in graph
added edge 10.000 from A to D in graph

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 2.000
C to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 4.000
