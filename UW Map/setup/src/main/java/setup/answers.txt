Problem 6.

(a)
Fibonacci failed because it threw an exception when n = 0, but n is not a non negative number,
so in the if statement, the test I used for it is n < 0 instead of n <= 0.

(b)
Fibonacci failed because in the second if comparision, it saids n <= 2. But since its 0 indexed,
the first two terms is at 0 and 1, so I fixed it to n <= 1.

(c)
Fibonacci failed because the function returned the difference instead of the sum of the numbers,
so I replaced the - with a + in the return statement
